# Algorithms-and-Data-Structure
This repository contains the solutions to the assignments of Algorithms and Data Structures Course, Spring 2023, at Constructor University Bremen.

# Course Overview
Algorithms and data structures are in the core of computer science. An algorithm is an effective description for calculations using a finite list of instructions that can be executed by a computer. A data structure is a concept for organizing data in a computer such that they can be used efficiently. This is an introductory course to learn about fundamental algorithms for solving problems efficiently, basic algorithmic concepts, fundamental data structures for efficiently storing, accessing, and modifying data, and the analysis of algorithms and data structures with respect to their computational and memory complexity. The presented concepts and techniques form the basis of almost all computer programs.
